# Deploy justlay.me to Vercel - Simple Steps

## Quick Deploy (5 minutes):

1. Open Command Prompt or Terminal
2. Navigate to your project:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\fastl\justlayme
   ```

3. Deploy to Vercel:
   ```
   vercel
   ```

4. Follow the prompts:
   - Link to existing project? **No**
   - What's your project name? **justlayme**
   - In which directory? **Hit Enter (current directory)**
   - Want to override settings? **No**

5. Add your custom domain:
   ```
   vercel domains add justlay.me
   ```

## The site will be live at justlay.me in minutes!

## About the API Issue:
Your site tries to call api.justlay.me for AI responses. You have two options:

### Option 1: Use a free AI API (Recommended for now)
I can update your code to use a free AI service

### Option 2: Set up your own API backend
This requires running an AI server

## Next Steps:
1. Run `vercel` in the justlayme folder
2. Your site will work everywhere - PC and mobile!
3. No special URLs, no Tailscale needed

The deployment will handle everything automatically!
